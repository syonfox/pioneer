I'm heading to 1975 to pick up an IBM 5100 computer to degbug legacy computer programs that haven't been ported properly to the machines of my time, but I'm stopping by here to collect information about your time before it's lost in the great calamity.\n\nI intend to return with a six part description on what's needed for time machines to operate. In short, my time machine is a stationary mass, temporal displacement unit, powered by two top-spin dual-positive singularities that produce a standard off-set tipler sinusoid. The displacement unit moves through time, not space.\n\nI will be happy to post pictures of the unit upon request."
